In 2011, Marc Andreessen famously said that “software is eating the world,” referring to the booming digital economy, at a time when many enterprises were facing the challenges of a digital transformation. Successful online businesses, using “online” and “mobile” operation modes, were taking over their traditional “brick-and-mortar” counterparts.

For example, imagine the traditional experience of buying a new camera in a photography shop: we would visit the shop, browse around, maybe ask a few questions of the clerk, make up our mind, and finally buy a model that fulfilled our desires and expectations. After finishing our purchase, the shop would have registered a credit card transaction—or only a cash balance change in case of a cash payment—and the shop manager would that know they have one less inventory item of that particular camera model.

Now, let’s take that experience online: first, we begin searching the web. We visit a couple of online stores, leaving digital traces as we pass from one to another. Advertisements on websites suddenly begin showing us promotions for the camera we were looking at as well as for competing alternatives. We finally find an online shop offering us the best deal and purchase the camera. We create an account. Our personal data is registered and linked to the purchase. While we complete our purchase, we are offered additional options that are allegedly popular with other people who bought the same camera. Each of our digital interactions, like searching for keywords on the web, clicking some link, or spending time reading a particular page generates a series of events that are collected and transformed into business value, like personalized advertisement or upsale recommendations.
