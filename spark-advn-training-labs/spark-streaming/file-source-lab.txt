First Console, Check the /tmp/input folder is empty 
ls /tmp/input

Second Console, Start the spark streaming job to look for any new files /tmp/input
spark-submit --class com.learning.spark.streaming.FileStreamExample /home/training/spark-course-examples/target/scala-2.11/spark-course-examples_2.11-1.0.jar

Now in First Console, Copy a file to see Spark Streaming will pick it or not.
cp /home/training/spark-course-examples/src/main/resources/sales.csv /tmp/input

After few seconds lets copy the second file
cp /home/training/spark-course-examples/src/main/resources/sales1.csv /tmp/input
