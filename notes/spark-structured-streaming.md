# Spark Structured Streaming

Structured streaming is a scalable, fault tolerant streaming processing engine built on top of Spark SQL engine. You can express your streaming computation the same way you would express a batch computation on static data.

- The system ensures end-to-end exactly-once fault-tolerance guarantees through checkpointing and Write-Ahead Logs
